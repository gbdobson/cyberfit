# cyberfit
Cyber-FIT is an agent-based modeling framework for simulating cyber warfare

This current version has a bug, please follow the following instructions for the code to work properly in the NetLogo interface:

1. Click Setup
2. Add three attackers
3. Load terrain
4. Add defensive cyber forces

If you follow those steps, in order, the simulation will work.  If you go out of order there is a bug with how I hard-coded some of the
turtle IDs.
